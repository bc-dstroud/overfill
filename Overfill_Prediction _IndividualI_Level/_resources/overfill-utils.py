        /*  Title: JOB_APPLICATION_CANCELLATION_WORKED
            Date: 1/2/2023
            Author: Dan Streeter
            Summary: 
                In order to better plan overfills, we know the proportion of workers that have successfully worked jobs out of the ones that were still in a successful                applied status at the time of job start.  This logic comes from the data team Time to Fill Logic 
            Ticket Information:

                BLUECREW.MYSQL_BLUECREW.TIME_SEGMENTS_ABSOLUTE

            Caveats and Notes:
                This doesn't check the people who worked of the applicants.  It only checks total successful applicants and number successfully worked.
