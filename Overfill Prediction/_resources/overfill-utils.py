    Runs SQL query to pull job-based show up rate data
    
    Parameters:
    - start_date: The first date of a job created to consider in the query.
    - end_date: The last date of a job start time local to consider in the query.  Usually, this date needs to be in the past to ensure work data is accurate in the dataset.

            Date: 1/2/2023
            Author: Dan Streeter
            Summary: 
                In order to better plan overfills, we know the proportion of workers that have successfully worked jobs out of the ones that were still in a successful                applied status at the time of job start.  This logic comes from the data team Time to Fill Logic

            Caveats and Notes:
                This doesn't check the people who worked of the applicants.  It only checks total successful applicants and number successfully worked.
